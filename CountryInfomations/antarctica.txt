[Antarctica]
Antarctica is the southernmost continent, comprising about 10% of Earth's land area.
It is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and is covered by ice that holds about 60% of the world's fresh water.
There is no native human population, but various countries conduct scientific research there.
The Antarctic Treaty System, signed by multiple nations, designates the continent for scientific research and prohibits military activity.
McMurdo Station, operated by the United States, is one of the research bases in Antarctica.
The region plays a crucial role in climate studies and understanding the Earth's history.
